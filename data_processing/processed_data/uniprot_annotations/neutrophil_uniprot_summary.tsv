TG	P01266	THYG_HUMAN	Thyroglobulin	2768	Acts as a substrate for the production of iodinated thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) (PubMed:17532758, PubMed:32025030). The synthesis of T3 and T4 involves iodination of selected tyrosine residues of TG/thyroglobulin followed by their oxidative coupling in the thyroid follicle lumen (PubMed:32025030). Following TG re-internalization and lysosomal-mediated proteolysis, T3 and T4 are released from the polypeptide backbone leading to their secretion into the bloodstream (P...	Secreted	0	0	18	11

MAFF	Q9ULX9	MAFF_HUMAN	Transcription factor MafF	164	Since they lack a putative transactivation domain, the small Mafs behave as transcriptional repressors when they dimerize among themselves (PubMed:8932385). However, they seem to serve as transcriptional activators by dimerizing with other (usually larger) basic-zipper proteins, such as NFE2L1/NRF1, and recruiting them to specific DNA-binding sites. Interacts with the upstream promoter region of the oxytocin receptor gene (PubMed:16549056, PubMed:8932385). May be a transcriptional enhancer in th...	Nucleus	0	0	9	1
