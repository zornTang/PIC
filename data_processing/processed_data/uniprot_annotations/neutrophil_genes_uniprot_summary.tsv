Interacts with the essential precursor of cell wall synthesis lipid II to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis (PubMed:20214904). Inhibits adenovirus infection via inhibition of viral disassembly at the vertex region, thereby restricting the release of internal capsid protein pVI, which is required for endosomal membrane penetration during cell entry (PubMed:18191790). In addition, interaction with adenovirus capsid leads to the redirection of viral particles to TLR4 thereby promoting a NLRP3-mediated inflammasome response and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta) release (PubMed:35080426).

IGHV4-34	P06331	Immunoglobulin heavy variable 4-34	V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chains that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268)	2

The absence of activity may be due to the inability of asparagine (instead of aspartate found in DPEP1/2) at position 359 to function as the acid/base catalyst and activate the nucleophilic water/hydroxide (PubMed:32325220). A tyrosine (instead of histidine) at position 269 reduces affinity for the beta zinc and may cause substrate steric hindrance (PubMed:32325220)	3

HORMAD1	Q86X24	HORMA domain-containing protein 1	Plays a key role in meiotic progression. Regulates 3 different functions during meiosis: ensures that sufficient numbers of processed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are available for successful homology search by increasing the steady-state numbers of single-stranded DSB ends. Promotes synaptonemal-complex formation independently of its role in homology search. Plays a key role in the male mid-pachytene checkpoint and the female meiotic prophase checkpoint: required for efficient build-up of ATR activity on unsynapsed chromosome regions, a process believed to form the basis of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) and meiotic prophase quality control in both sexes	3

Acts as a pattern receptor that binds to murein peptidoglycans (PGN) of Gram-positive bacteria and thus provides bactericidal activity (PubMed:9707603). Forms an equimolar complex with heat shock protein HSPA1A and induces programmed cell death through apoptosis and necroptosis in tumor cell lines by activating the TNFR1 receptor on the target cell membrane (PubMed:21247889, PubMed:26183779). In addition, acts in complex with the Ca(2+)-binding protein S100A4 as a chemoattractant able to induce lymphocyte movement (PubMed:26654597). Mechanistically, this complex acts as a ligand of the chemotactic receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 which are present on the cells of the immune system (PubMed:30713770). Also promotes the activation of lymphocytes that become able to kill virus-infected cells as well as tumor cells by modulating the spectrum of their target-cell specificity (PubMed:28977785, PubMed:29083508). Induction of cytotoxicity on monocyte surface requires interaction with TREM1 receptor (PubMed:25595774, PubMed:28977785)	1
IYD	Q6PHW0	Iodotyrosine deiodinase 1	Catalyzes the dehalogenation of halotyrosines such as 3-bromo-L-tyrosine, 3-chloro-L-tyrosine, 3-iodo-L-tyrosine and 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine (PubMed:15289438, PubMed:18434651, PubMed:25395621, PubMed:28157283). During thyroid hormone biosynthesis, facilitates iodide salvage by catalysing the oxidative NADPH-dependent deiodination of the halogenated by-products of thyroid hormone production, monoiodotyrosine (L-MIT) and diiodotyrosine (L-DIT) (PubMed:15289438, PubMed:18434651). The scavanged iodide can then reenter the hormone-producing pathways (PubMed:15289438, PubMed:18434651). Acts more efficiently on 3-iodo-L-tyrosine than 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine (PubMed:15289438)	6
VIL1	P09327	Villin-1	Epithelial cell-specific Ca(2+)-regulated actin-modifying protein that modulates the reorganization of microvillar actin filaments. Plays a role in the actin nucleation, actin filament bundle assembly, actin filament capping and severing. Binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA); binds LPA with higher affinity than PIP2. Binding to LPA increases its phosphorylation by SRC and inhibits all actin-modifying activities. Binding to PIP2 inhibits actin-capping and -severing activities but enhances actin-bundling activity. Regulates the intestinal epithelial cell morphology, cell invasion, cell migration and apoptosis. Protects against apoptosis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in the gastrointestinal epithelium. Appears to regulate cell death by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Enhances hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced epithelial cell motility, chemotaxis and wound repair.

COX6B2	Q6YFQ2	Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B2	Component of the cytochrome c oxidase, the last enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of subunit 2 and heme A of subunit 1 to the active site in subunit 1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)). The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix	1
PRDM9	Q9NQV7	Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase PRDM9	Histone methyltransferase that sequentially mono-, di-, and tri-methylates both 'Lys-4' (H3K4) and 'Lys-36' (H3K36) of histone H3 to produce respectively trimethylated 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) and trimethylated 'Lys-36' (H3K36me3) histone H3 and plays a key role in meiotic prophase by determining hotspot localization thereby promoting meiotic recombination (PubMed:24095733, PubMed:24634223, PubMed:26833727, PubMed:27129774). Can also methylate all four core histones with H3 being the best substrate and the most highly modified (PubMed:24095733, PubMed:24634223, PubMed:26833727). Is also able, on one hand, to mono and di-methylate H4K20 and on other hand to trimethylate H3K9 with the di-methylated H3K9 as the best substrate (By similarity). During meiotic prophase, binds specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger domains thereby determining hotspot localization where it promotes local H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on the same nucleosomes through its histone methyltransferase activity (PubMed:26833727). Thereby promotes double-stranded breaks (DSB) formation, at this subset of PRDM9-binding sites, that initiates meiotic recombination for the proper meiotic progression (By similarity). During meiotic progression hotspot-bound PRDM9 interacts with several complexes; in early leptonema binds CDYL and EHMT2 followed by EWSR1 and CXXC1 by the end of leptonema. EWSR1 joins PRDM9 with the chromosomal axis through REC8 (By similarity). In this way, controls the DSB repair pathway, pairing of homologous chromosomes and sex body formation (By similarity). Moreover plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of genes during early meiotic prophase thanks to H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment that represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation (By similarity). In addition performs automethylation (By similarity). Acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 attenuate or prevent histone H3 methylation (By similarity)	53

Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation (PubMed:30674671). Acts as a recognition receptor (PRR): recognizes and binds specific pathogens and other damage-associated signals, such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, or double stranded RNA (dsRNA) (PubMed:30392956, PubMed:33377178, PubMed:34678144).

The NLRP6 inflammasome acts by promoting recruitment of effector pro-inflammatory caspases (CASP1 and/or CASP4) that catalyze maturation and secretion of IL1B and IL18 in the extracellular milieu (PubMed:12387869, PubMed:30392956, PubMed:30674671, PubMed:34678144). The NLRP6 inflammasome plays a central role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity and host defense against microbial infections in the intestine (PubMed:30392956). Required to restrict infection against Gram-positive bacteria by recognizing lipoteichoic acid (LTA), leading to recruitment of CASP4 and CASP1, and subsequent maturation and secretion of IL1B and IL18 (PubMed:30392956, PubMed:33377178).

ALPK1	Q96QP1	Alpha-protein kinase 1	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that detects bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern metabolites (PAMPs) and initiates an innate immune response, a critical step for pathogen elimination and engagement of adaptive immunity (PubMed:28222186, PubMed:28877472, PubMed:30111836). Specifically recognizes and binds ADP-D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose (ADP-Heptose), a potent PAMP present in all Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria (PubMed:30111836). ADP-Heptose-binding stimulates its kinase activity to phosphorylate and activate TIFA, triggering pro-inflammatory NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:30111836). May be involved in monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU)-induced inflammation by mediating phosphorylation of unconventional myosin MYO9A (PubMed:27169898).

ALPL	P05186	Alkaline phosphatase, tissue-nonspecific isozyme	Alkaline phosphatase that metabolizes various phosphate compounds and plays a key role in skeletal mineralization and adaptive thermogenesis (PubMed:12162492, PubMed:23688511, PubMed:25982064). Has broad substrate specificity and can hydrolyze a considerable variety of compounds: however, only a few substrates, such as diphosphate (inorganic pyrophosphate; PPi), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and N-phosphocreatine are natural substrates (PubMed:12162492, PubMed:2220817). Plays an essential role in skeletal and dental mineralization via its ability to hydrolyze extracellular diphosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor, to phosphate: it thereby promotes hydroxyapatite crystal formation and increases inorganic phosphate concentration (PubMed:23688511, PubMed:25982064). Acts in a non-redundant manner with PHOSPHO1 in skeletal mineralization: while PHOSPHO1 mediates the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the matrix vesicles (MVs), ALPL/TNAP catalyzes the spread of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Also promotes dephosphorylation of osteopontin (SSP1), an inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystallization in its phosphorylated state; it is however unclear whether ALPL/TNAP mediates SSP1 dephosphorylation via a direct or indirect manner (By similarity). Catalyzes dephosphorylation of PLP to pyridoxal (PL), the transportable form of vitamin B6, in order to provide a sufficient amount of PLP in the brain, an essential cofactor for enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of diverse neurotransmitters (PubMed:20049532, PubMed:2220817). Additionally, also able to mediate ATP degradation in a stepwise manner to adenosine, thereby regulating the availability of ligands for purinergic receptors (By similarity). Also capable of dephosphorylating microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as well as other phosphorylated small-molecules, such as poly-inosine:cytosine (poly I:C) (PubMed:28448526). Acts as a key regulator of adaptive thermogenesis as part of the futile creatine cycle: localizes to the mitochondria of thermogenic fat cells and acts by mediating hydrolysis of N-phosphocreatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine dephosphorylation and phosphorylation (By similarity). During the futile creatine cycle, creatine and N-phosphocreatine are in a futile cycle, which dissipates the high energy charge of N-phosphocreatine as heat without performing any mechanical or chemical work (By similarity)	3

ANGPT1	Q15389	Angiopoietin-1	Binds and activates TEK/TIE2 receptor by inducing its dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation. Plays an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis, endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion and cell spreading, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, but also maintenance of vascular quiescence. Required for normal angiogenesis and heart development during embryogenesis. After birth, activates or inhibits angiogenesis, depending on the context. Inhibits angiogenesis and promotes vascular stability in quiescent vessels, where endothelial cells have tight contacts. In quiescent vessels, ANGPT1 oligomers recruit TEK to cell-cell contacts, forming complexes with TEK molecules from adjoining cells, and this leads to preferential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the AKT1 signaling cascades. In migrating endothelial cells that lack cell-cell adhesions, ANGT1 recruits TEK to contacts with the extracellular matrix, leading to the formation of focal adhesion complexes, activation of PTK2/FAK and of the downstream kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, and ultimately to the stimulation of sprouting angiogenesis. Mediates blood vessel maturation/stability. Implicated in endothelial developmental processes later and distinct from that of VEGF. Appears to play a crucial role in mediating reciprocal interactions between the endothelium and surrounding matrix and mesenchyme	4

In GC B-cells, represses genes that function in differentiation, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle control, also autoregulates its transcriptional expression and up-regulates, indirectly, the expression of some genes important for GC reactions, such as AICDA, through the repression of microRNAs expression, like miR155. An important function is to allow GC B-cells to proliferate very rapidly in response to T-cell dependent antigens and tolerate the physiological DNA breaks required for immunglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation without inducing a p53/TP53-dependent apoptotic response. In follicular helper CD4(+) T-cells (T(FH) cells), promotes the expression of T(FH)-related genes but inhibits the differentiation of T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 cells. Also required for the establishment and maintenance of immunological memory for both T- and B-cells. Suppresses macrophage proliferation through competition with STAT5 for STAT-binding motifs binding on certain target genes, such as CCL2 and CCND2. In response to genotoxic stress, controls cell cycle arrest in GC B-cells in both p53/TP53-dependedent and -independent manners.

Found in a partially open conformation leading to significantly smaller chloride movement (PubMed:35789156). Upon F2R/PAR-1 activation, the sequestered calcium is released into the cytosol of astrocytes, leading to the (Ca2+)-dependent release of L-glutamate into the synaptic cleft that targets the neuronal postsynaptic GRIN2A/NMDAR receptor resulting in the synaptic plasticity regulation (By similarity). Upon activation of the norepinephrine-alpha-1 adrenergic receptor signaling pathway, transports as well D-serine than L-glutamate in a (Ca2+)-dependent manner, leading to activation of adjacent NMDAR receptors and therefore regulates the heterosynaptic long-term depression and metaplasticity during initial memory acquisition (By similarity).

Catalyzes the reaction through a substrate-mediated reduction pathway, whereby NADH shuttles electrons to 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone, which then transfers the electrons to the two Fe(3+) centers (PubMed:23445365). The binding of 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQn) mediates reduction of the diiron center by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and initiates oxygen activation for subsequent DMQ hydroxylation (PubMed:23445365). The physiological substrates are 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-nonaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(9)) and 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(10)), however in vitro the enzyme does not have any specificity concerning the length of the polyprenyl tail, and accepts tails of various lengths with similar efficiency (PubMed:23445365, PubMed:28409910).

Its function is mediated through the activation of several signaling pathways including phospholipase C (PLC), intracellular calcium, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB and Rho (PubMed:28445455). Can also be transactivated by cleaved F2R/PAR1. Involved in modulation of inflammatory responses and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, and acts as a sensor for proteolytic enzymes generated during infection. Generally is promoting inflammation. Can signal synergistically with TLR4 and probably TLR2 in inflammatory responses and modulates TLR3 signaling. Has a protective role in establishing the endothelial barrier; the activity involves coagulation factor X. Regulates endothelial cell barrier integrity during neutrophil extravasation, probably following proteolytic cleavage by PRTN3 (PubMed:23202369). Proposed to have a bronchoprotective role in airway epithelium, but also shown to compromise the airway epithelial barrier by interrupting E-cadherin adhesion (PubMed:10086357). Involved in the regulation of vascular tone; activation results in hypotension presumably mediated by vasodilation. Associates with a subset of G proteins alpha subunits such as GNAQ, GNA11, GNA14, GNA12 and GNA13, but probably not with G(o)-alpha, G(i) subunit alpha-1 and G(i) subunit alpha-2. However, according to PubMed:21627585 can signal through G(i) subunit alpha. Believed to be a class B receptor which internalizes as a complex with arrestin and traffic with it to endosomal vesicles, presumably as desensitized receptor, for extended periods of time. Mediates inhibition of TNF-alpha stimulated JNK phosphorylation via coupling to GNAQ and GNA11; the function involves dissociation of RIPK1 and TRADD from TNFR1. Mediates phosphorylation of nuclear factor NF-kappa-B RELA subunit at 'Ser-536'; the function involves IKBKB and is predominantly independent of G proteins. Involved in cellular migration. Involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and chemotaxis through beta-arrestin-promoted scaffolds; the function is independent of GNAQ and GNA11 and involves promotion of cofilin dephosphorylation and actin filament severing. Induces redistribution of COPS5 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and activation of the JNK cascade is mediated by COPS5. Involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to the sites of inflammation and is the major PAR receptor capable of modulating eosinophil function such as pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, superoxide production and degranulation. During inflammation promotes dendritic cell maturation, trafficking to the lymph nodes and subsequent T-cell activation. Involved in antimicrobial response of innate immune cells; activation enhances phagocytosis of Gram-positive and killing of Gram-negative bacteria. Acts synergistically with interferon-gamma in enhancing antiviral responses. Implicated in a number of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases such as of the joints, lungs, brain, gastrointestinal tract, periodontium, skin, and vascular systems, and in autoimmune disorders. Probably mediates activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses in fibroblasts, triggered by coagulation factor Xa (F10) (By similarity).

FBXL13	Q8NEE6	F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 13	Substrate-recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), a key regulator of ciliary/flagellar motility which maintains the alignment and integrity of the distal axoneme and regulates microtubule sliding in motile axonemes. Specifically targets CEP192 isoform 3 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and thereby acts as a regulator of microtubule nucleation activity (PubMed:29348145)	9
FBXL5	Q9UKA1	F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5	Component of some SCF (SKP1-cullin-F-box) protein ligase complex that plays a central role in iron homeostasis by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IREB2/IRP2 (PubMed:19762596, PubMed:19762597). The C-terminal domain of FBXL5 contains a redox-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster that, upon oxidation, promotes binding to IRP2 to effect its oxygen-dependent degradation (PubMed:32126207). Under iron deficiency conditions, the N-terminal hemerythrin-like (Hr) region, which contains a diiron metal center, cannot bind iron and undergoes conformational changes that destabilize the FBXL5 protein and cause its ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:19762596, PubMed:19762597). When intracellular iron levels start rising, the Hr region is stabilized (PubMed:19762596, PubMed:19762597). Additional increases in iron levels facilitate the assembly and incorporation of a redox active [2Fe-2S] cluster in the C-terminal domain (PubMed:32126207). Only when oxygen level is high enough to maintain the cluster in its oxidized state can FBXL5 recruit IRP2 as a substrate for polyubiquination and degradation (PubMed:32126207). Promotes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the dynactin complex component DCTN1 (PubMed:17532294). Within the nucleus, promotes the ubiquitination of SNAI1; preventing its interaction with DNA and promoting its degradation (PubMed:24157836). Negatively regulates DNA damage response by mediating the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of the DNA repair protein NABP2 (PubMed:25249620)	9

FCHO2	Q0JRZ9	F-BAR domain only protein 2	Functions in an early step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Has both a membrane binding/bending activity and the ability to recruit proteins essential to the formation of functional clathrin-coated pits. Has a lipid-binding activity with a preference for membranes enriched in phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides (Pi(4,5) biphosphate) like the plasma membrane. Its membrane-bending activity might be important for the subsequent action of clathrin and adaptors in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. Involved in adaptor protein complex AP-2-dependent endocytosis of the transferrin receptor, it also functions in the AP-2-independent endocytosis of the LDL receptor	4
FFAR2	O15552	Free fatty acid receptor 2	G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by a major product of dietary fiber digestion, the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and that plays a role in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis and in intestinal immunity. In omnivorous mammals, the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate are produced primarily by the gut microbiome that metabolizes dietary fibers. SCFAs serve as a source of energy but also act as signaling molecules. That G protein-coupled receptor is probably coupled to the pertussis toxin-sensitive, G(i/o)-alpha family of G proteins but also to the Gq family (PubMed:12496283, PubMed:12711604, PubMed:23589301). Its activation results in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, the phosphorylation of the MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2 kinases and the inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation. May play a role in glucose homeostasis by regulating the secretion of GLP-1, in response to short-chain fatty acids accumulating in the intestine. May also regulate the production of LEP/Leptin, a hormone acting on the central nervous system to inhibit food intake. Finally, may also regulate whole-body energy homeostasis through adipogenesis regulating both differentiation and lipid storage of adipocytes. In parallel to its role in energy homeostasis, may also mediate the activation of the inflammatory and immune responses by SCFA in the intestine, regulating the rapid production of chemokines and cytokines. May also play a role in the resolution of the inflammatory response and control chemotaxis in neutrophils. In addition to SCFAs, may also be activated by the extracellular lectin FCN1 in a process leading to activation of monocytes and inducing the secretion of interleukin-8/IL-8 in response to the presence of microbes (PubMed:21037097). Among SCFAs, the fatty acids containing less than 6 carbons, the most potent activators are probably acetate, propionate and butyrate (PubMed:12496283, PubMed:12711604). Exhibits a SCFA-independent constitutive G protein-coupled receptor activity (PubMed:23066016)	3
FFAR3	O14843	Free fatty acid receptor 3	G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by a major product of dietary fiber digestion, the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and that plays a role in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis and in intestinal immunity. In omnivorous mammals, the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate are produced primarily by the gut microbiome that metabolizes dietary fibers. SCFAs serve as a source of energy but also act as signaling molecules. That G protein-coupled receptor is probably coupled to the pertussis toxin-sensitive, G(i/o)-alpha family of G proteins. Its activation results in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, the phosphorylation of the MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2 kinases and the inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation (PubMed:12711604). Activated by SCFAs and by beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body produced by the liver upon starvation, it inhibits N-type calcium channels and modulates the activity of sympathetic neurons through a signaling cascade involving the beta and gamma subunits of its coupled G protein, phospholipase C and MAP kinases. Thereby, it may regulate energy expenditure through the control of the sympathetic nervous system that controls for instance heart rate. Upon activation by SCFAs accumulating in the intestine, it may also signal to the brain via neural circuits which in turn would regulate intestinal gluconeogenesis. May also control the production of hormones involved in whole-body energy homeostasis. May for instance, regulate blood pressure through renin secretion. May also regulate secretion of the PYY peptide by enteroendocrine cells and control gut motility, intestinal transit rate, and the harvesting of energy from SCFAs produced by gut microbiota. May also indirectly regulate the production of LEP/Leptin, a hormone acting on the CNS to inhibit food intake, in response to the presence of short-chain fatty acids in the intestine. Finally, may also play a role in glucose homeostasis. Besides its role in energy homeostasis, may play a role in intestinal immunity. May mediate the activation of the inflammatory and immune response by SCFAs in the gut, regulating the rapid production of chemokines and cytokines by intestinal epithelial cells. Among SCFAs, the fatty acids containing less than 6 carbons, the most potent activators are probably propionate, butyrate and pentanoate while acetate is a poor activator (PubMed:12496283, PubMed:12711604)	12

Seems to act as a chaperone for BCL2, targets it to the mitochondria and modulates its phosphorylation state. The BCL2/FKBP8/calmodulin/calcium complex probably interferes with the binding of BCL2 to its targets. The active form of FKBP8 may therefore play a role in the regulation of apoptosis.

FNIP1	Q8TF40	Folliculin-interacting protein 1	Binding partner of the GTPase-activating protein FLCN: involved in the cellular response to amino acid availability by regulating the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling cascade controlling the MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:17028174, PubMed:18663353, PubMed:24081491, PubMed:37079666). Required to promote FLCN recruitment to lysosomes and interaction with Rag GTPases, leading to activation of the non-canonical mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:24081491). In low-amino acid conditions, component of the lysosomal folliculin complex (LFC) on the membrane of lysosomes, which inhibits the GTPase-activating activity of FLCN, thereby inactivating mTORC1 and promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3 (By similarity). Upon amino acid restimulation, disassembly of the LFC complex liberates the GTPase-activating activity of FLCN, leading to activation of mTORC1 and subsequent inactivation of TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:37079666). Together with FLCN, regulates autophagy: following phosphorylation by ULK1, interacts with GABARAP and promotes autophagy (PubMed:25126726). In addition to its role in mTORC1 signaling, also acts as a co-chaperone of HSP90AA1/Hsp90: following gradual phosphorylation by CK2, inhibits the ATPase activity of HSP90AA1/Hsp90, leading to activate both kinase and non-kinase client proteins of HSP90AA1/Hsp90 (PubMed:27353360, PubMed:30699359). Acts as a scaffold to load client protein FLCN onto HSP90AA1/Hsp90 (PubMed:27353360). Competes with the activating co-chaperone AHSA1 for binding to HSP90AA1, thereby providing a reciprocal regulatory mechanism for chaperoning of client proteins (PubMed:27353360). Also acts as a core component of the reductive stress response by inhibiting activation of mitochondria in normal conditions: in response to reductive stress, the conserved Cys degron is reduced, leading to recognition and polyubiquitylation by the CRL2(FEM1B) complex, followed by proteasomal (By similarity). Required for B-cell development (PubMed:32905580)	2
FOS	P01100	Protein c-Fos	Nuclear phosphoprotein which forms a tight but non-covalently linked complex with the JUN/AP-1 transcription factor. In the heterodimer, FOS and JUN/AP-1 basic regions each seems to interact with symmetrical DNA half sites. On TGF-beta activation, forms a multimeric SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complex at the AP1/SMAD-binding site to regulate TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Has a critical function in regulating the development of cells destined to form and maintain the skeleton. It is thought to have an important role in signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation. In growing cells, activates phospholipid synthesis, possibly by activating CDS1 and PI4K2A. This activity requires Tyr-dephosphorylation and association with the endoplasmic reticulum	11

FOXO3	O43524	Forkhead box protein O3	Transcriptional activator that recognizes and binds to the DNA sequence 5'-[AG]TAAA[TC]A-3' and regulates different processes, such as apoptosis and autophagy (PubMed:10102273, PubMed:16751106, PubMed:21329882, PubMed:30513302). Acts as a positive regulator of autophagy in skeletal muscle: in starved cells, enters the nucleus following dephosphorylation and binds the promoters of autophagy genes, such as GABARAP1L, MAP1LC3B and ATG12, thereby activating their expression, resulting in proteolysis of skeletal muscle proteins (By similarity). Triggers apoptosis in the absence of survival factors, including neuronal cell death upon oxidative stress (PubMed:10102273, PubMed:16751106). Participates in post-transcriptional regulation of MYC: following phosphorylation by MAPKAPK5, promotes induction of miR-34b and miR-34c expression, 2 post-transcriptional regulators of MYC that bind to the 3'UTR of MYC transcript and prevent its translation (PubMed:21329882). In response to metabolic stress, translocates into the mitochondria where it promotes mtDNA transcription (PubMed:23283301). In response to metabolic stress, translocates into the mitochondria where it promotes mtDNA transcription. Also acts as a key regulator of chondrogenic commitment of skeletal progenitor cells in response to lipid availability: when lipids levels are low, translocates to the nucleus and promotes expression of SOX9, which induces chondrogenic commitment and suppresses fatty acid oxidation (By similarity). Also acts as a key regulator of regulatory T-cells (Treg) differentiation by activating expression of FOXP3 (PubMed:30513302)	1
FPR1	P21462	fMet-Leu-Phe receptor	High affinity receptor for N-formyl-methionyl peptides (fMLP), which are powerful neutrophil chemotactic factors (PubMed:10514456, PubMed:15153520, PubMed:2161213, PubMed:2176894). Binding of fMLP to the receptor stimulates intracellular calcium mobilization and superoxide anion release (PubMed:15153520, PubMed:15210802, PubMed:1712023, PubMed:2161213). This response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (PubMed:10514456, PubMed:1712023). Receptor for TAFA4, mediates its effects on chemoattracting macrophages, promoting phagocytosis and increasing ROS release (PubMed:25109685).

Involved in formation of autophagosomal vacuoles (PubMed:20404487). While LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation (PubMed:20404487). Through its interaction with the reticulophagy receptor TEX264, participates in the remodeling of subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum into autophagosomes upon nutrient stress, which then fuse with lysosomes for endoplasmic reticulum turnover (PubMed:31006537, PubMed:31006538)	7

GDF15	Q99988	Growth/differentiation factor 15	Hormone produced in response to various stresses to confer information about those stresses to the brain, and trigger an aversive response, characterized by nausea, vomiting, and/or loss of appetite (PubMed:23468844, PubMed:24971956, PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846098, PubMed:28846099, PubMed:28953886, PubMed:29046435, PubMed:30639358, PubMed:31875646, PubMed:33589633, PubMed:38092039). The aversive response is both required to reduce continuing exposure to those stresses at the time of exposure and to promote avoidance behavior in the future (PubMed:30639358, PubMed:33589633, PubMed:38092039). Acts by binding to its receptor, GFRAL, activating GFRAL-expressing neurons localized in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem (PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846098, PubMed:28846099, PubMed:28953886, PubMed:31535977). It then triggers the activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central amygdala, which constitutes part of the 'emergency circuit' that shapes responses to stressful conditions (PubMed:28953886). The GDF15-GFRAL signal induces expression of genes involved in metabolism, such as lipid metabolism in adipose tissues (PubMed:31402172). Required for avoidance behavior in response to food allergens: induced downstream of mast cell activation to promote aversion and minimize harmful effects of exposure to noxious substances (By similarity). In addition to suppress appetite, also promotes weight loss by enhancing energy expenditure in muscle: acts by increasing calcium futile cycling in muscle (By similarity). Contributes to the effect of metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, on appetite reduction and weight loss: produced in the kidney in response to metformin treatment, thereby activating the GDF15-GFRAL response, leading to reduced appetite and weight (PubMed:31875646, PubMed:37060902). The contribution of GDF15 to weight loss following metformin treatment is however limited and subject to discussion (PubMed:36001956). Produced in response to anticancer drugs, such as camptothecin or cisplatin, promoting nausea, vomiting and contributing to malnutrition (By similarity). Overproduced in many cancers, promoting anorexia in cancer (cachexia) (PubMed:32661391). Responsible for the risk of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy: high levels of GDF15 during pregnancy, mostly originating from the fetus, are associated with increased nausea and vomiting (PubMed:38092039). Maternal sensitivity to nausea is probably determined by pre-pregnancy exposure to GDF15, women with naturally high level of GDF15 being less susceptible to nausea than women with low levels of GDF15 before pregnancy (PubMed:38092039). Promotes metabolic adaptation in response to systemic inflammation caused by bacterial and viral infections in order to promote tissue tolerance and prevent tissue damage (PubMed:31402172). Required for tissue tolerance in response to myocardial infarction by acting as an inhibitor of leukocyte integring activation, thereby protecting against cardiac rupture (By similarity).

GLT1D1	Q96MS3	Glycosyltransferase 1 domain-containing protein 1		3
GLUL	P15104	Glutamine synthetase	Glutamine synthetase that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine (PubMed:16267323, PubMed:30158707, PubMed:36289327). Its role depends on tissue localization: in the brain, it regulates the levels of toxic ammonia and converts neurotoxic glutamate to harmless glutamine, whereas in the liver, it is one of the enzymes responsible for the removal of ammonia (By similarity). Plays a key role in ammonium detoxification during erythropoiesis: the glutamine synthetase activity is required to remove ammonium generated by porphobilinogen deaminase (HMBS) during heme biosynthesis to prevent ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress (By similarity). Essential for proliferation of fetal skin fibroblasts (PubMed:18662667). Independently of its glutamine synthetase activity, required for endothelial cell migration during vascular development: acts by regulating membrane localization and activation of the GTPase RHOJ, possibly by promoting RHOJ palmitoylation (PubMed:30158707). May act as a palmitoyltransferase for RHOJ: able to autopalmitoylate and then transfer the palmitoyl group to RHOJ (PubMed:30158707). Plays a role in ribosomal 40S subunit biogenesis (PubMed:26711351). Through the interaction with BEST2, inhibits BEST2 channel activity by affecting the gating at the aperture in the absence of intracellular L-glutamate, but sensitizes BEST2 to intracellular L-glutamate, which promotes the opening of BEST2 and thus relieves its inhibitory effect on BEST2 (PubMed:36289327)	4
GNA11	P29992	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades (PubMed:31073061). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:31073061). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:31073061). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:31073061). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:31073061). Signaling is mediated via phospholipase C-beta-dependent inositol lipid hydrolysis for signal propagation: activates phospholipase C-beta: following GPCR activation, GNA11 activates PLC-beta (PLCB1, PLCB2, PLCB3 or PLCB4), leading to production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (PubMed:31073061). Transduces FFAR4 signaling in response to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (PubMed:27852822). Together with GNAQ, required for heart development (By similarity).

Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260)	8

Binds iron through association with 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA), a siderophore that shares structural similarities with bacterial enterobactin, and delivers or removes iron from the cell, depending on the context. Iron-bound form (holo-24p3) is internalized following binding to the SLC22A17 (24p3R) receptor, leading to release of iron and subsequent increase of intracellular iron concentration. In contrast, association of the iron-free form (apo-24p3) with the SLC22A17 (24p3R) receptor is followed by association with an intracellular siderophore, iron chelation and iron transfer to the extracellular medium, thereby reducing intracellular iron concentration. Involved in apoptosis due to interleukin-3 (IL3) deprivation: iron-loaded form increases intracellular iron concentration without promoting apoptosis, while iron-free form decreases intracellular iron levels, inducing expression of the proapoptotic protein BCL2L11/BIM, resulting in apoptosis (By similarity). Involved in innate immunity; limits bacterial proliferation by sequestering iron bound to microbial siderophores, such as enterobactin (PubMed:27780864).

While LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation (PubMed:20713600). Through its interaction with the reticulophagy receptor TEX264, participates in the remodeling of subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum into autophagosomes upon nutrient stress, which then fuse with lysosomes for endoplasmic reticulum turnover (PubMed:31006537, PubMed:31006538)	1
MAP2K4	P45985	Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4	Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K7/MKK7, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The phosphorylation of the Thr residue by MAP2K7/MKK7 seems to be the prerequisite for JNK activation at least in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, while other stimuli activate both MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 which synergistically phosphorylate JNKs. MAP2K4 is required for maintaining peripheral lymphoid homeostasis. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. Whereas MAP2K7/MKK7 exclusively activates JNKs, MAP2K4/MKK4 additionally activates the p38 MAPKs MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14	5
MAP2K6	P52564	Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6	Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. With MAP3K3/MKK3, catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinases p38 MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14 and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular responses to cytokines and all kinds of stresses. Especially, MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 are both essential for the activation of MAPK11 and MAPK13 induced by environmental stress, whereas MAP2K6/MKK6 is the major MAPK11 activator in response to TNF. MAP2K6/MKK6 also phosphorylates and activates PAK6. The p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway leads to direct activation of transcription factors. Nuclear targets of p38 MAP kinase include the transcription factors ATF2 and ELK1. Within the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway, MAP3K6/MKK6 mediates phosphorylation of STAT4 through MAPK14 activation, and is therefore required for STAT4 activation and STAT4-regulated gene expression in response to IL-12 stimulation. The pathway is also crucial for IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and down-regulation of IL-6-mediated gene induction; and for IFNG-dependent gene transcription. Has a role in osteoclast differentiation through NF-kappa-B transactivation by TNFSF11, and in endochondral ossification and since SOX9 is another likely downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway. MAP2K6/MKK6 mediates apoptotic cell death in thymocytes. Acts also as a regulator for melanocytes dendricity, through the modulation of Rho family GTPases	6

MAPK3	P27361	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3	Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway (PubMed:34497368). MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DEPTOR, FRS2 or GRB10) (PubMed:35216969). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade	10

Also acts as a regulator of minus-end microtubule organization: interacts with the complex formed by AKAP9 and PDE4DIP, leading to recruit CAMSAP2 to the Golgi apparatus, thereby tethering non-centrosomal minus-end microtubules to the Golgi, an important step for polarized cell movement (PubMed:28814570). Promotes elongation of CAMSAP2-decorated microtubule stretches on the minus-end of microtubules (PubMed:28814570)	2
MARCKS	P29966	Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate	Membrane-associated protein that plays a role in the structural modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, chemotaxis, motility, cell adhesion, phagocytosis, and exocytosis through lipid sequestering and/or protein docking to membranes (PubMed:23704996, PubMed:36009319). Thus, exerts an influence on a plethora of physiological processes, such as embryonic development, tissue regeneration, neuronal plasticity, and inflammation. Sequesters phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at lipid rafts in the plasma membrane of quiescent cells, an action reversed by protein kinase C, ultimately inhibiting exocytosis (PubMed:23704996). During inflammation, promotes the migration and adhesion of inflammatory cells and the secretion of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), particularly in macrophages (PubMed:37949888). Plays an essential role in bacteria-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in the monocytic cell type. Participates in the regulation of neurite initiation and outgrowth by interacting with components of cellular machinery including CDC42 that regulates cell shape and process extension through modulation of the cytoskeleton (By similarity).

The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. In a non-canonical activation pathway, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. The NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p52 complex is a transcriptional activator. The NF-kappa-B p52-p52 homodimer is a transcriptional repressor. NFKB2 appears to have dual functions such as cytoplasmic retention of attached NF-kappa-B proteins by p100 and generation of p52 by a cotranslational processing. The proteasome-mediated process ensures the production of both p52 and p100 and preserves their independent function. p52 binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3', located in the enhancer region of genes involved in immune response and acute phase reactions. p52 and p100 are respectively the minor and major form; the processing of p100 being relatively poor. Isoform p49 is a subunit of the NF-kappa-B protein complex, which stimulates the HIV enhancer in synergy with p65. In concert with RELB, regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer	2

Recruits AP-2 and attaches clathrin triskelions to the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane leading to clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) assembly (PubMed:10436022, PubMed:16262731, PubMed:27574975). Furthermore, regulates clathrin-coated vesicle size and maturation by directly sensing and driving membrane curvature (PubMed:25898166). In addition to binding to clathrin, mediates the endocytosis of small R-SNARES (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein REceptors) between plasma membranes and endosomes including VAMP2, VAMP3, VAMP4, VAMP7 or VAMP8 (PubMed:21808019, PubMed:22118466, PubMed:23741335). In turn, PICALM-dependent SNARE endocytosis is required for the formation and maturation of autophagic precursors (PubMed:25241929). Modulates thereby autophagy and the turnover of autophagy substrates such as MAPT/TAU or amyloid precursor protein cleaved C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) (PubMed:24067654, PubMed:25241929)	14

May contribute to tumorigenesis through: the delivery of survival signaling through phosphorylation of BAD which induces release of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L), the regulation of cell cycle progression, protein synthesis and by regulation of MYC transcriptional activity. Additionally to this role on tumorigenesis, can also negatively regulate insulin secretion by inhibiting the activation of MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2), through SOCS6. Involved also in the control of energy metabolism and regulation of AMPK activity in modulating MYC and PPARGC1A protein levels and cell growth	2
PINK1	Q9BXM7	Serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1, mitochondrial	Serine/threonine-protein kinase which acts as a sensor of mitochondrial damage and protects against mitochondrial dysfunction during cellular stress. It phosphorylates mitochondrial proteins to coordinate mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove and replace dysfunctional mitochondrial components (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:18443288, PubMed:18957282, PubMed:19229105, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20547144, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23754282, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24751536, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:24898855, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32484300). Depending on the severity of mitochondrial damage, activity ranges from preventing apoptosis and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis to eliminating severely damaged mitochondria via PINK1-PRKN-dependent mitophagy (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:18443288, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24898855, PubMed:32047033, PubMed:32484300). When cellular stress results in irreversible mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) where it phosphorylates pre-existing polyubiquitin chains at 'Ser-65', recruits PRKN from the cytosol to the OMM and activates PRKN by phosphorylation at 'Ser-65'; activated PRKN then ubiquinates VDAC1 and other OMM proteins to initiate mitophagy (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:23754282, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24751536, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32047033). The PINK1-PRKN pathway also promotes fission of damaged mitochondria through phosphorylation and PRKN-dependent degradation of mitochondrial proteins involved in fission such as MFN2 (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:24898855). This prevents the refusion of unhealthy mitochondria with the mitochondrial network or initiates mitochondrial fragmentation facilitating their later engulfment by autophagosomes (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:23620051). Also promotes mitochondrial fission independently of PRKN and ATG7-mediated mitophagy, via the phosphorylation and activation of DNM1L (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:32484300). Regulates motility of damaged mitochondria by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MIRO1 and MIRO2; in motor neurons, this likely inhibits mitochondrial intracellular anterograde transport along the axons which probably increases the chance of the mitochondria undergoing mitophagy in the soma (PubMed:22396657). Required for ubiquinone reduction by mitochondrial complex I by mediating phosphorylation of complex I subunit NDUFA10 (By similarity). Phosphorylates LETM1, positively regulating its mitochondrial calcium transport activity (PubMed:29123128)	1

In lipid droplet triacylglycerol hydrolysis, plays a role as a scaffolding protein for three major key lipolytic players: ABHD5, PNPLA2 and LIPE. Reduces the triacylglycerol hydrolase activity of PNPLA2 by recruiting and sequestering PNPLA2 to lipid droplets. Phosphorylation by PKA enables lipolysis probably by promoting release of ABHD5 from the perilipin scaffold and by facilitating interaction of ABHD5 with PNPLA2. Also increases lipolysis through interaction with LIPE and upon PKA-mediated phosphorylation of LIPE (By similarity)	2

Involved in regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (PubMed:26387735). It is proposed that its association with the mPTP is masking a binding site for inhibiting inorganic phosphate (Pi) and promotes the open probability of the mPTP leading to apoptosis or necrosis; the requirement of the PPIase activity for this function is debated (PubMed:26387735). In cooperation with mitochondrial p53/TP53 is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis (PubMed:22726440).

PTGS2	P35354	Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2	Dual cyclooxygenase and peroxidase in the biosynthesis pathway of prostanoids, a class of C20 oxylipins mainly derived from arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate, AA, C20:4(n-6)), with a particular role in the inflammatory response (PubMed:11939906, PubMed:16373578, PubMed:19540099, PubMed:22942274, PubMed:26859324, PubMed:27226593, PubMed:7592599, PubMed:7947975, PubMed:9261177). The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes (PubMed:16373578, PubMed:22942274, PubMed:26859324, PubMed:27226593, PubMed:7592599, PubMed:7947975, PubMed:9261177). This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons (PubMed:16373578, PubMed:22942274, PubMed:26859324, PubMed:27226593, PubMed:7592599, PubMed:7947975, PubMed:9261177). Similarly catalyzes successive cyclooxygenation and peroxidation of dihomo-gamma-linoleate (DGLA, C20:3(n-6)) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) to corresponding PGH1 and PGH3, the precursors of 1- and 3-series prostaglandins (PubMed:11939906, PubMed:19540099). In an alternative pathway of prostanoid biosynthesis, converts 2-arachidonoyl lysophopholipids to prostanoid lysophopholipids, which are then hydrolyzed by intracellular phospholipases to release free prostanoids (PubMed:27642067). Metabolizes 2-arachidonoyl glycerol yielding the glyceryl ester of PGH2, a process that can contribute to pain response (PubMed:22942274). Generates lipid mediators from n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via a lipoxygenase-type mechanism. Oxygenates PUFAs to hydroperoxy compounds and then reduces them to corresponding alcohols (PubMed:11034610, PubMed:11192938, PubMed:9048568, PubMed:9261177). Plays a role in the generation of resolution phase interaction products (resolvins) during both sterile and infectious inflammation (PubMed:12391014). Metabolizes docosahexaenoate (DHA, C22:6(n-3)) to 17R-HDHA, a precursor of the D-series resolvins (RvDs) (PubMed:12391014). As a component of the biosynthetic pathway of E-series resolvins (RvEs), converts eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) primarily to 18S-HEPE that is further metabolized by ALOX5 and LTA4H to generate 18S-RvE1 and 18S-RvE2 (PubMed:21206090). In vascular endothelial cells, converts docosapentaenoate (DPA, C22:5(n-3)) to 13R-HDPA, a precursor for 13-series resolvins (RvTs) shown to activate macrophage phagocytosis during bacterial infection (PubMed:26236990). In activated leukocytes, contributes to oxygenation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoates (HETE) to diHETES (5,15-diHETE and 5,11-diHETE) (PubMed:22068350, PubMed:26282205). Can also use linoleate (LA, (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoate, C18:2(n-6)) as substrate and produce hydroxyoctadecadienoates (HODEs) in a regio- and stereospecific manner, being (9R)-HODE ((9R)-hydroxy-(10E,12Z)-octadecadienoate) and (13S)-HODE ((13S)-hydroxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoate) its major products (By similarity). During neuroinflammation, plays a role in neuronal secretion of specialized preresolving mediators (SPMs) 15R-lipoxin A4 that regulates phagocytic microglia (By similarity)	5

RAF1	P04049	RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts as a regulatory link between the membrane-associated Ras GTPases and the MAPK/ERK cascade, and this critical regulatory link functions as a switch determining cell fate decisions including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, survival and oncogenic transformation. RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation	31

RAPGEF2	Q9Y4G8	Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2	Functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates Rap and Ras family of small GTPases by exchanging bound GDP for free GTP in a cAMP-dependent manner. Serves as a link between cell surface receptors and Rap/Ras GTPases in intracellular signaling cascades. Also acts as an effector for Rap1 by direct association with Rap1-GTP thereby leading to the amplification of Rap1-mediated signaling. Shows weak activity on HRAS. It is controversial whether RAPGEF2 binds cAMP and cGMP (PubMed:23800469, PubMed:10801446) or not (PubMed:10548487, PubMed:10608844, PubMed:11359771). Its binding to ligand-activated beta-1 adrenergic receptor ADRB1 leads to the Ras activation through the G(s)-alpha signaling pathway. Involved in the cAMP-induced Ras and Erk1/2 signaling pathway that leads to sustained inhibition of long term melanogenesis by reducing dendrite extension and melanin synthesis. Also provides inhibitory signals for cell proliferation of melanoma cells and promotes their apoptosis in a cAMP-independent nanner. Regulates cAMP-induced neuritogenesis by mediating the Rap1/B-Raf/ERK signaling through a pathway that is independent on both PKA and RAPGEF3/RAPGEF4. Involved in neuron migration and in the formation of the major forebrain fiber connections forming the corpus callosum, the anterior commissure and the hippocampal commissure during brain development. Involved in neuronal growth factor (NGF)-induced sustained activation of Rap1 at late endosomes and in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced axon outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. Plays a role in the regulation of embryonic blood vessel formation and in the establishment of basal junction integrity and endothelial barrier function. May be involved in the regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR and cadherin CDH5 expression at allantois endothelial cell-cell junctions	7
RARA	P10276	Retinoic acid receptor alpha	Receptor for retinoic acid (PubMed:16417524, PubMed:19850744, PubMed:20215566, PubMed:21152046, PubMed:37478846). Retinoic acid receptors bind as heterodimers to their target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, and regulate gene expression in various biological processes (PubMed:21152046, PubMed:28167758, PubMed:37478846). The RXR/RAR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) composed of tandem 5'-AGGTCA-3' sites known as DR1-DR5 (PubMed:19398580, PubMed:28167758). In the absence of ligand, the RXR-RAR heterodimers associate with a multiprotein complex containing transcription corepressors that induce histone deacetylation, chromatin condensation and transcriptional suppression (PubMed:16417524). On ligand binding, the corepressors dissociate from the receptors and associate with the coactivators leading to transcriptional activation (PubMed:19850744, PubMed:20215566, PubMed:37478846, PubMed:9267036). Formation of a complex with histone deacetylases might lead to inhibition of RARE DNA element binding and to transcriptional repression (PubMed:28167758). Transcriptional activation and RARE DNA element binding might be supported by the transcription factor KLF2 (PubMed:28167758). RARA plays an essential role in the regulation of retinoic acid-induced germ cell development during spermatogenesis (By similarity). Has a role in the survival of early spermatocytes at the beginning prophase of meiosis (By similarity). In Sertoli cells, may promote the survival and development of early meiotic prophase spermatocytes (By similarity).

Together with RXRA, positively regulates microRNA-10a expression, thereby inhibiting the GATA6/VCAM1 signaling response to pulsatile shear stress in vascular endothelial cells (PubMed:28167758). In association with HDAC3, HDAC5 and HDAC7 corepressors, plays a role in the repression of microRNA-10a and thereby promotes the inflammatory response (PubMed:28167758)	12

RBM47	A0AV96	RNA-binding protein 47	Single-stranded RNA-binding protein that functions in a variety of RNA processes, including alternative splicing, RNA stabilization, and RNA editing (PubMed:24038582, PubMed:24916387, PubMed:27050523, PubMed:30844405, PubMed:31358901, PubMed:34160127). Functions as an enzyme-substrate adapter for the cytidine deaminase APOBEC1. With APOBEC1 forms an mRNA editing complex involved into cytidine to uridine editing of a variety of mRNA molecules (PubMed:24038582, PubMed:24916387, PubMed:30844405). Through the binding of their 3'UTR, also stabilizes a variety of mRNAs and regulates the expression of genes such as the interferon alpha/beta receptor and interleukin-10 (PubMed:34160127).

RBP7	Q96R05	Retinoid-binding protein 7	Intracellular transport of retinol	3
RELB	Q01201	Transcription factor RelB	NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor which is present in almost all cell types and is involved in many biological processed such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p50 and RelB-p52 complexes are transcriptional activators. RELB neither associates with DNA nor with RELA/p65 or REL. Stimulates promoter activity in the presence of NFKB2/p49. As a member of the NUPR1/RELB/IER3 survival pathway, may provide pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with remarkable resistance to cell stress, such as starvation or gemcitabine treatment. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer in a CRY1/CRY2 independent manner. Increased repression of the heterodimer is seen in the presence of NFKB2/p52. Is required for both T and B lymphocyte maturation and function (PubMed:26385063)	5

Plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure in response to signaling via G protein-coupled receptors and GNAQ. Plays a role in regulating the constriction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (By similarity). Binds EIF2B5 and blocks its activity, thereby inhibiting the translation of mRNA into protein (PubMed:19736320)	2
RHOB	P62745	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoB	Mediates apoptosis in neoplastically transformed cells after DNA damage. Not essential for development but affects cell adhesion and growth factor signaling in transformed cells. Plays a negative role in tumorigenesis as deletion causes tumor formation.

Causes the formation of thin, actin-rich surface projections called filopodia	6
RICTOR	Q6R327	Rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR	Component of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), which transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19995915, PubMed:21343617, PubMed:33158864, PubMed:35904232, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21343617). Within the mTORC2 complex, RICTOR probably acts as a molecular adapter (PubMed:21343617, PubMed:33158864, PubMed:35926713). RICTOR is responsible for the FKBP12-rapamycin-insensitivity of mTORC2 (PubMed:33158864). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:35926713). mTORC2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' and of PRKCA on 'Ser-657' (By similarity). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). mTORC2 acts upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, probably by activating one or more Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 promotes the serum-induced formation of stress-fibers or F-actin (PubMed:15467718)	5
RIGI	O95786	Antiviral innate immune response receptor RIG-I	Innate immune receptor that senses cytoplasmic viral nucleic acids and activates a downstream signaling cascade leading to the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:15208624, PubMed:15708988, PubMed:16125763, PubMed:16127453, PubMed:16153868, PubMed:17190814, PubMed:18636086, PubMed:19122199, PubMed:19211564, PubMed:24366338, PubMed:28469175, PubMed:29117565, PubMed:31006531, PubMed:34935440, PubMed:35263596, PubMed:36793726). Forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with viral RNAs on which it homooligomerizes to form filaments (PubMed:15208624, PubMed:15708988). The homooligomerization allows the recruitment of RNF135 an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that activates and amplifies the RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling in an RNA length-dependent manner through ubiquitination-dependent and -independent mechanisms (PubMed:28469175, PubMed:31006531). Upon activation, associates with mitochondria antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/IPS1) that activates the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE which in turn phosphorylate the interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, activating transcription of antiviral immunological genes including the IFN-alpha and IFN-beta interferons (PubMed:28469175, PubMed:31006531). Ligands include 5'-triphosphorylated ssRNAs and dsRNAs but also short dsRNAs (<1 kb in length) (PubMed:15208624, PubMed:15708988, PubMed:19576794, PubMed:19609254, PubMed:21742966). In addition to the 5'-triphosphate moiety, blunt-end base pairing at the 5'-end of the RNA is very essential (PubMed:15208624, PubMed:15708988, PubMed:19576794, PubMed:19609254, PubMed:21742966). Overhangs at the non-triphosphorylated end of the dsRNA RNA have no major impact on its activity (PubMed:15208624, PubMed:15708988, PubMed:19576794, PubMed:19609254, PubMed:21742966). A 3'overhang at the 5'triphosphate end decreases and any 5'overhang at the 5' triphosphate end abolishes its activity (PubMed:15208624, PubMed:15708988, PubMed:19576794, PubMed:19609254, PubMed:21742966). Detects both positive and negative strand RNA viruses including members of the families Paramyxoviridae: Human respiratory syncytial virus and measles virus (MeV), Rhabdoviridae: vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Orthomyxoviridae: influenza A and B virus, Flaviviridae: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV) and west Nile virus (WNV) (PubMed:21616437, PubMed:21884169).

RRAGD	Q9NQL2	Ras-related GTP-binding protein D	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to amino acid availability through regulation of the mTORC1 signaling cascade (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:34607910). Forms heterodimeric Rag complexes with RagA/RRAGA or RagB/RRAGB and cycles between an inactive GTP-bound and an active GDP-bound form: RagD/RRAGD is in its active form when GDP-bound RagD/RRAGD forms a complex with GTP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) and in an inactive form when GTP-bound RagD/RRAGD heterodimerizes with GDP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) (PubMed:24095279). In its active form, promotes the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and its subsequent activation by the GTPase RHEB (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279). This is a crucial step in the activation of the MTOR signaling cascade by amino acids (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279). Also plays a central role in the non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB and specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3: GDP-bound RagD/RRAGD mediates recruitment of MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:32612235)	1
RSAD2	Q8WXG1	S-adenosylmethionine-dependent nucleotide dehydratase RSAD2	Interferon-inducible antiviral protein which plays a major role in the cell antiviral state induced by type I and type II interferon (PubMed:31812350). Catalyzes the conversion of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) via a SAM-dependent radical mechanism (PubMed:29925952, PubMed:30872404). In turn, ddhCTP acts as a chain terminator for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from multiple viruses and directly inhibits viral replication (PubMed:29925952). Therefore, inhibits a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), west Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus, sindbis virus, influenza A virus, sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), zika virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) (PubMed:29925952, PubMed:30587778, PubMed:30934824, PubMed:31921110).

Acts by antagonizing RUBCN, thereby stimulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity of the PI3K/PI3KC3 complex (PubMed:28306502). Following anchorage to the autophagosomal SNARE STX17, promotes the recruitment of PI3K/PI3KC3 and HOPS complexes to the autophagosome to regulate the fusion specificity of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes (PubMed:28306502). Binds phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) and 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P) (PubMed:28306502).

RXRA	P19793	Retinoic acid receptor RXR-alpha	Receptor for retinoic acid that acts as a transcription factor (PubMed:10874028, PubMed:11162439, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:37478846). Forms homo- or heterodimers with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and binds to target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, to regulate gene expression in various biological processes (PubMed:10195690, PubMed:11162439, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:16107141, PubMed:17761950, PubMed:18800767, PubMed:19167885, PubMed:28167758, PubMed:37478846). The RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) composed of tandem 5'-AGGTCA-3' sites known as DR1-DR5 to regulate transcription (PubMed:10195690, PubMed:11162439, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:17761950, PubMed:28167758). The high affinity ligand for retinoid X receptors (RXRs) is 9-cis retinoic acid (PubMed:1310260). In the absence of ligand, the RXR-RAR heterodimers associate with a multiprotein complex containing transcription corepressors that induce histone deacetylation, chromatin condensation and transcriptional suppression (PubMed:20215566). On ligand binding, the corepressors dissociate from the receptors and coactivators are recruited leading to transcriptional activation (PubMed:20215566, PubMed:37478846, PubMed:9267036). Serves as a common heterodimeric partner for a number of nuclear receptors, such as RARA, RARB and PPARA (PubMed:10195690, PubMed:11915042, PubMed:28167758, PubMed:29021580). The RXRA/RARB heterodimer can act as a transcriptional repressor or transcriptional activator, depending on the RARE DNA element context (PubMed:29021580). The RXRA/PPARA heterodimer is required for PPARA transcriptional activity on fatty acid oxidation genes such as ACOX1 and the P450 system genes (PubMed:10195690). Together with RARA, positively regulates microRNA-10a expression, thereby inhibiting the GATA6/VCAM1 signaling response to pulsatile shear stress in vascular endothelial cells (PubMed:28167758).

It can induce neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, can increase the bactericidal activity of neutrophils by promoting phagocytosis via activation of SYK, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2 and can induce degranulation of neutrophils by a MAPK-dependent mechanism (PubMed:12626582, PubMed:15331440, PubMed:20103766). Predominantly found as calprotectin (S100A8/A9) which has a wide plethora of intra- and extracellular functions (PubMed:16258195, PubMed:19122197, PubMed:8423249). The intracellular functions include: facilitating leukocyte arachidonic acid trafficking and metabolism, modulation of the tubulin-dependent cytoskeleton during migration of phagocytes and activation of the neutrophilic NADPH-oxidase (PubMed:15331440, PubMed:21325622). Also participates in regulatory T-cell differentiation together with CD69 (PubMed:26296369). Activates NADPH-oxidase by facilitating the enzyme complex assembly at the cell membrane, transferring arachidonic acid, an essential cofactor, to the enzyme complex and S100A8 contributes to the enzyme assembly by directly binding to NCF2/P67PHOX (PubMed:15642721, PubMed:22808130). The extracellular functions involve pro-inflammatory, antimicrobial, oxidant-scavenging and apoptosis-inducing activities (PubMed:19534726, PubMed:8423249). Its pro-inflammatory activity includes recruitment of leukocytes, promotion of cytokine and chemokine production, and regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration (PubMed:15598812, PubMed:21487906). Acts as an alarmin or a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and stimulates innate immune cells via binding to pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGER) (PubMed:19402754). Binding to TLR4 and AGER activates the MAP-kinase and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways resulting in the amplification of the pro-inflammatory cascade (PubMed:19402754, PubMed:22804476). Has antimicrobial activity towards bacteria and fungi and exerts its antimicrobial activity probably via chelation of Zn(2+) which is essential for microbial growth (PubMed:19087201). Can induce cell death via autophagy and apoptosis and this occurs through the cross-talk of mitochondria and lysosomes via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the process involves BNIP3 (PubMed:19935772). Can regulate neutrophil number and apoptosis by an anti-apoptotic effect; regulates cell survival via ITGAM/ITGB and TLR4 and a signaling mechanism involving MEK-ERK (PubMed:22363402). Its role as an oxidant scavenger has a protective role in preventing exaggerated tissue damage by scavenging oxidants (PubMed:21912088, PubMed:22489132). Can act as a potent amplifier of inflammation in autoimmunity as well as in cancer development and tumor spread (PubMed:16258195).

The iNOS-S100A8/A9 transnitrosylase complex is proposed to also direct selective inflammatory stimulus-dependent S-nitrosylation of multiple targets such as ANXA5, EZR, MSN and VIM by recognizing a [IL]-x-C-x-x-[DE] motif (PubMed:25417112)	1

Catalyzes the synthesis of ceramide phosphoethanolamines (CPEs) (such as N-acylsphing-4-enine 1-phosphoethanolamine) by transferring phosphoethanolamine head group, which is smaller and more hydrophilic than the phosphocholine (PC) headgroup transferred in the canonical sphingomyelin synthesis (SMS) reaction by SMS1 or SMS2, from a phosphatidylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, PE) to a ceramide (such as N-acylsphing-4-enine) (PubMed:19506037, PubMed:38388831). The larger PC prevents an efficient fit in the enzyme's catalytic pocket, leading to little or no SMS activity (PubMed:19506037, PubMed:38388831).

Acts as a suppressor of miRNA biogenesis by mediating the terminal uridylation of some miRNA precursors, including that of let-7 (pre-let-7). Uridylated pre-let-7 RNA is not processed by Dicer and undergo degradation. Pre-let-7 uridylation is strongly enhanced in the presence of LIN28A (PubMed:22898984). In the absence of LIN28A, TUT7 and TUT4 monouridylate group II pre-miRNAs, which includes most of pre-let7 members, that shapes an optimal 3' end overhang for efficient processing (PubMed:25979828, PubMed:28671666).

Functions by recruiting the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and components of the cytoplasmic RNA decay machinery to the bound ARE-containing mRNAs, and hence promotes ARE-mediated mRNA deadenylation and decay processes (PubMed:15687258, PubMed:18326031, PubMed:25106868). Also induces the degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs even in absence of poly(A) tail (By similarity). Binds to 3'-UTR ARE of numerous mRNAs (PubMed:12198173, PubMed:15467755, PubMed:15538381, PubMed:17030608, PubMed:19179481, PubMed:20702587, PubMed:24700863, PubMed:25014217, PubMed:25106868, PubMed:26542173). Positively regulates early adipogenesis by promoting ARE-mediated mRNA decay of immediate early genes (IEGs) (By similarity). Promotes ARE-mediated mRNA decay of mineralocorticoid receptor NR3C2 mRNA in response to hypertonic stress (PubMed:24700863). Negatively regulates hematopoietic/erythroid cell differentiation by promoting ARE-mediated mRNA decay of the transcription factor STAT5B mRNA (PubMed:20702587). Positively regulates monocyte/macrophage cell differentiation by promoting ARE-mediated mRNA decay of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6 mRNA (PubMed:26542173). Promotes degradation of ARE-containing pluripotency-associated mRNAs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), such as NANOG, through a fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced MAPK-dependent signaling pathway, and hence attenuates ESC self-renewal and positively regulates mesendoderm differentiation (By similarity). May play a role in mediating pro-apoptotic effects in malignant B-cells by promoting ARE-mediated mRNA decay of BCL2 mRNA (PubMed:25014217). In association with ZFP36L2 maintains quiescence on developing B lymphocytes by promoting ARE-mediated decay of several mRNAs encoding cell cycle regulators that help B cells progress through the cell cycle, and hence ensuring accurate variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombination and functional immune cell formation (By similarity). Together with ZFP36L2 is also necessary for thymocyte development and prevention of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) transformation by promoting ARE-mediated mRNA decay of the oncogenic transcription factor NOTCH1 mRNA (By similarity). Participates in the delivery of target ARE-mRNAs to processing bodies (PBs) (PubMed:17369404). In addition to its cytosolic mRNA-decay function, plays a role in the regulation of nuclear mRNA 3'-end processing; modulates mRNA 3'-end maturation efficiency of the DLL4 mRNA through binding with an ARE embedded in a weak noncanonical polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal in endothelial cells (PubMed:21832157). Also involved in the regulation of stress granule (SG) and P-body (PB) formation and fusion (PubMed:15967811). Plays a role in vasculogenesis and endocardial development (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (PubMed:27182009). Plays a role in myoblast cell differentiation (By similarity)	4
